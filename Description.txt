The aim of the project is to identify the structural domains of a given protein. 
The protein PDB file can be imported from locally or from the PDB database. 
The program calculates the least connected parts in the protein and plots the results on the GUI. 
The workload is distributed evenly, but Orsolya will be mainly responsible for the GUI implementation, 
while Istv√°n will be responsible for the domain finder algorithm implementation. 
For version control and cooperative work, GitHub will be used.
